# Some notes

* The pysnow module in PyPI has a dependency that collides with other packages like Pandas (pytz<=2019.3>)

If you encounter this problem, feel free to fork and modify the package, or use

```
pip install git+https://github.com/dcompane/pysnow.git
```

* Look at the README for the [bash](../../Bash/README.md) or the [Helix ITSM](../../Python/Helix%20ITSM/README.md) for additional information on the script and its use.
