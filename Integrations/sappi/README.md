## Detailed Description

This Control-M Application Integrator job type enables the automation of SAP PI channels.

The job uses SAP PI REST API services to request a channel action.

The AI plug-in can run on Windows and Unix (bash and csh), and this template can be easily adapted to other shells as needed.

The objective of this fully functional module is to show how easy it is to configure a job type based on any application that has an available API.

The job form also allows to load the channels properties using load options to ensure no typos occur when adding the required parameters to the job.

For additional information on the REST API Adapter, see the [PI REST Adapter overview SAP Blog](https://blogs.sap.com/2014/12/18/pi-rest-adapter-blog-overview/)

The available actions are:

    Start
        Start
        Start and monitor for a specific state, and raise an error and fail the job if not received.
        Start and Stop the channel after a specified time
    Check
        Check for a specific status
    Stop the channel
